### Features
* Gateway session with auto-reconnection on failure.
* Wrapper that hides weird API details.
* Using HTTP persistent connection to reduce overhead in series of REST requests.
* Minimal runtime dependencies.

### Installation

#### Requirements
* CMake 3.0+
* GCC 4.8.1+ or Clang 3.3+ or other C++11 compatible compiler
* boost.asio 1.56+
* OpenSSL 1.0.1+
* boost.beast (submodule or system)
* _(Optional)_ Doxygen, if you also want to build documentation
* _(Optional)_ Zlib, if you want to use gateway message compression

**Note:** Versions is approximate and can be actually lower or higher, please report any problems with versions in 
specified range.

Following command should be enough for everything on debian-based distros:
```
# apt-get install cmake gcc doxygen libz-dev libboost-dev libboost-system-dev libssl-dev
```

#### Installation
```
$ git clone https://github.com/foxcpp/Hexicord.git  # clone repository
$ cd Hexicord
$ git submodule update --init                       # download boost.beast
$ mkdir build; cd build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release               # configure build system, Release enabled optimizations.
```
You can also enable `HEXICORD_SHARED` if you need shared library, `HEXICORD_STATIC` is enabled by default.
```
$ make
```

### Usage

Library contain two big classes `Hexicord::GatewayClient` and `Hexicord::Restclient`.
First maintains persistent gateway connection for real-time events, next one provides
interface to REST API methods.

There is simple echo bot:
```cpp
#include <boost/asio/io_service.hpp>
#include <hexicord/gateway_client.hpp>
#include <hexicord/rest_client.hpp>

using namespace Hexicord;

int main() {
    boost::asio::io_service ioService;
    GatewayClient gclient(ioService, "PUT YOUR TOKEN HERE");
    RestClient    rclient(ioService, "PUT YOUR TOKEN HERE");

    gclient.eventsDispatcher.addHandler(Event::MessageCreate, [&client](const nlohmann::json& message) {
        rclient.sendTextMessage(Hexicord::Snowflake(message["channel_id"].get<std::string>()), message["content"]);
    });

    gclient.connect(rclient.getGatewayUrlBot().first); // replace with rclient.getGatewayUrl() if not using bot account.
    ios.run(); 
}
```

### Examples

See [examples/](examples/).

### Documentation

Documentation is generated using [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) if `HEXICORD_DOCS` option is enabled 
(default if Doxygen found).

```
$ cmake . -DHEXICORD_DOCS=ON
$ make doc
```
Output will be in `docs/`.

Also documentation for latest release can be browsed online [here](https://foxcpp.github.io/Hexicord).


### Contributing

Here is some of the ways that you can contribute:
* Submit a bug report. We love hearing about broken things, so that we can fix them.
* Provide feedback. Even simple questions about how things work or why they were done a certain way carries value.
* Test code. Checkout `dev` branch, compile it and start trying to break stuff! :-)
* Write code. Check issues marked with 
[**help wanted**](https://github.com/foxcpp/hexicord/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) tag. 

##### Code style
In short: camelCase (snake_case for files), 4 spaces indent, { on same line.
Nobody likes to read long style guides, right? If you unsure about something else - just look at code.
